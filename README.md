# Drawing Fish Game

Implemented in Gamemaker LTS. This is my firsh attempt at using Gamemaker. The game is a single kids game where you control a fish and have to survive in the harsh ocean environment. All drawings were made by my daughter.

# Building
You need Gamemaker LTS in order to build this game. Clone the repo and open in GM, choose your target device and build. This should mostly work for Windows. The game also supports mobile touch screen, so if you want to compile for Android, please read GM tutorials on how to setup Android builds
