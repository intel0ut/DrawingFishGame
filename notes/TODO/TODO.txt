V add manager object to show messages to user
- Fix scale of enemies and player when starting level/boss entering room
- finish painting the sprites
- maybe add animation to the sprites (swim, bite)
- add a XP bar in place of the player HP bar
- add hp bar to top of player
- XP bar will keep track of player level
	- XP will only increment
	- each level has a next_level_xp that increases as the player level is higher
- food recovers HP and give small amount of XP
- other fish gives XP only
- level up recovers HP
- rework food spawn to limit how much food spawn in each level. 
	- total should be enough to fight boss and amount spawn decrease with the player level
- once player reach a condition for each level, spawn a "mini Boss"
	- "A big fish is coming!"
	- mini boss is one of the fish from next level with more HP and bigger size
	- level will be similar to player level
	- player must hit the boss to inflict damage
		- boss damage player too, maybe player need food to recover hp?
	- Conditions:
